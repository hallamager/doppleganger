                                        <p>Doppelganger Productions is a none-profit company limited by guarantee (company no: 8174535) formed in 2012. A new writing theatre company based in Bournemouth, we produce innovative stage work by emerging and established theatre makers with a focus upon Dorset-based playwrights. We aim to create a vibrant theatre culture in Bournemouth and to present our work to audiences nationally and internationally. </p>

                                        <p>We have performed work at the Lighthouse, Poole; Bournemouth University; the Rex Cinema, Wareham; Vita Nova (Boscombe Fringe), Boscombe; the Winchester Arts Pub, Bournemouth; the Shelley Theatre, Boscombe; Chaplin’s Bar, Boscombe; Bournemouth Town Hall; Regent’s College, London; the Charing Cross Theatre, London; the Bread and Roses Theatre, London – and additionally in a number of site-specific venues in Dorset. We have staged a number of plays in the Bournemouth Arts by the Sea Festival and in Bournemouth University’s Festival of Learning. In 2014, funded by Arts Council England, we mounted a ten-venue South-West tour of a play evoking local history – Robert Louis Stevenson in Bournemouth struggling to write The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hide – underwriting our commitment to local theatre and to local subject matter which avoids parochialism.</p>

                                        <p>A recent development has been in the creation of specialist workshops – radio and television scriptwriting, poetry, Twitter fiction, graphic fiction. Production opportunities are offered in radio and television projects. Last year we launched Doppelganger Firsts, a spin-off from the workshop involving a series of rehearsed readings of new stage plays we would like to subsequently put into production.</p>

                    <p>After a sell-out performance of John Foster’s gripping courtroom drama, Shot at Dawn, atmospherically staged in Bournemouth Town Hall’s Council Chambers, Doppelganger Productions is launching a Dorset wide tour of the performance in 2016.</p>
                    <p>This compelling and emotional drama is based on the story of two young men from the Dorsetshire Regiment, on trial for cowardice. The outcome of a guilty verdict? Execution by firing squad.</p>
                    <p>The touring production will be dramatically brought to life as it is performed in historic courtrooms across Dorset. From the emotionally charged Shire Hall in Dorchester with its original Georgian courtroom where the Tolpuddle Martyres were tried and held; the magnificent Guildhall in Poole, formerly the town’s Magistrate’s Court; the historic Corn Exchange in Blandford Forum and the intimate Council Chambers in Bridport’s original Town Hall. All the venues reinforce the stark reality that soldiers were denied legal representation and the right of appeal.</p>

                    <p>John Foster spent time studying the original transcripts from the trials, which were until recently restricted from public access. Now for the first time this material is available, and combined with first-hand eyewitness letters, diaries and accounts, the story reveals how these two heroes were suffering from what we now know as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, yet were condemned to death for their perceived disloyalty.</p>
                    <p>The strength and originality of this new production has been acknowledged with support from national funding through the Arts Council Grants for the Arts, Heritage Lottery, The Big Lottery Fund, West Dorset District Council, Arts University Bournemouth and Poole Borough Council.</p>
                    <p>With 8 performances in 4 stunning locations, audiences can expect a truly unique piece of theatre with a chance to learn more by attending the programme of talks and Q & A’s. Plus a chance to come along to one of the 4 afternoon Tea Dances, to help build up the Living Memories project of Dorset during the great war.</p>

                    <h4>DORSET THEATRE REVIEWS</h4>

                    <p>This was a play about happiness, or was it? Could it have been about sadness or loneliness? I expect if you asked the audience you would get a lot of different views.</p>

                    <p>The writer John Foster certainly has a way with words and I would be interested to read other plays by him. The direction was tight and made good use of the stage especially as there were only two people and one was seated behind a desk for a lot of the time.</p>

                    <p>The opening didn’t convince me as it was difficult to hear the Doctors lines over the very loud music and I am not sure why she broke into the disco bit. However when the patient entered, the play really got going.
                    </p>

                    <p>HAP played by Nicola Lauren Stringfellow and Doctor Marples played by Emma Loveday were superb. This was an hour plus of non-stop action, which kept the audience on the edge of their seats wondering what would happen.
                    </p>

                    <p>Both characters played their parts to perfection with good pauses and facial expressions but never letting the pace drop. Well done to both of you as it is very difficult to laugh on cue and also quite a marathon to learn.
                    </p>


                    <h4>Bread & Roses Theatre - Review</h4>

                    <p>"You're a pathological optimist." So says Troy Dyer – Ethan Hawke's charcter in the 1994 film, Reaity Bites. But can a person be excessively happy? Real life physician Hunter ‘Patch’ Adams was criticised many years ago in his official medical school record for "excessive happiness"... In John Foster's new comedy HAP, which is directed Charmaine K Parkin, questions regarding the necessity of happiness and 'negative' experiences to give life meaning are deftly explored. Nicola Lauren Stringfellow plays the euphoric HAP, while Martha Marples – the GP she come to for help – is played by Emma Loveday.</p>

                    <p>To give the play its context, much time is given at the beginning with Marples when she's alone in her room at the practice. A sufferer of depression, she spendS some time willing herself 'in the right head space', so that her emotions don't interfere with her professional judgement during the working day. Much time is also devoted to her writing in notebook – as much a cathartic exercise as a distraction from dealing with the job at hand.</p>

                    <p>The sound of uncontrolled laughter from outside the room cuts through the ambience like a knife, not unlike the 'lunatic' on Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. What will win in the end? The unfettered jovality of HAP or the composed introspection of Marples?
                    </p>

                    <p>After a long discourse involving HAP convincing Marples that her malady is for real and that she wants help, Marples repeatedly tells her how lucky she is. But HAP's argument has a logic to it – that without the ability to experience the other spectrum of emotions, how can she be a 'fully functioning human being'? If nothing else, being always 'happy' when friends are experiencing hard times raises questions about the development of one's capacity for empathy, with potential detrimental effects on relationships.
                    </p>

                    <p>Plays that scrutinise the DNA of comedy and laughter in an objective fashion such as Trevor Griffiths' Comedians and Terry Johnson's Funny People, often have as serious point to make about its place in our lives. While Foster's play is a 'fantasy' with a heightened reality, this doesn't detract from the play's astute message about the quest for emotional well-being, especially between women.
                    </p>
                    <p>During the Q&A at the end of one performance, a member of the audience – a man of about 50 – asked why two women were written, instead of having at least one man. The lack of female-only plays was raised, but the answer I liked best was the unique dynamic that two women have on stage. A male GP automatically suggests the patriarchy subjugating the freedom of women to feel however they feel, but woman to woman it is a discourse about being in touch with one's emotions – whatever they may be – and acknowledging them without judgement.<br> Michael Davis 2016

                    <p>THE NOT SO PATHETIC – MORE OF A GIANT – PANDA: A REVIEW BY JANE SKELLET</p>

                    <p>Well, this was the first of the ‘Firsts’ for the Doppelgangers.</p>

                    <p>For a few years now, they have been meeting every month on a Saturday afternoon, to help nurture and encourage new writers with their scripts and stories.</p>

                    <p>I well remember – just over a year ago – when Vin Kaluza introduced us to ‘something he was working on’ – and how he was experimenting with writing a whole play for just one character. He had actor Steve Rollins with him, ready and prepared to render a reading of the first section, opening with the memorable malfunctioning toilet – a symbol for the malfunctioning life of his would-be hero, Bracey.</p>

                    <p>So it was with high anticipation that I joined the full-house of Doppleganger supporters in Chaplin’s Bar in Boscombe on Saturday afternoon, to see how Vin’s idea had grown into a full piece. And what a full piece this is! If Vin had reservations about one character sustaining a full-length drama, then Steve gave us a tour-de-force performance, animating a cleverly crafted script, which uses all the storyteller’s techniques to have us believe that there are at least another half dozen characters popping in and out of the patchwork of anecdotal scenes that take us on Bracey’s hellish attempts to break from a life of crime – and grime.</p>

                    <p>Presented as a rehearsed reading, the quirky little theatre space in the Cellar Bar with its jazzy murals leant just the right atmosphere of intimacy, as we were drawn into Bracey’s cage-like life of violence and domestic turmoil; and the technique of screwing up the pages of script as they were spent, and watching them pile up around the stage, was a clever way of incorporating the physical script into the action, whilst also symbolising the gradual destruction and waste of Bracey’s life.</p>

                    <p>Director, Nicola Hosking and producer, Laura Harvey have worked some magic here to bring this all together in such a polished presentation that maintained the tension and suspense throughout the afternoon with such limited resources.</p>

                    <p>And it’s also a tribute to John Foster’s hard work in setting up the Doppelganger Dialogues network that encourages new writers in developing their work; and to Nick Taylor, who is now the main co-ordinator, looking forward to developing a further series of ‘Firsts’ – as other new writers will have opportunities to see their work presented for an audience.</p>

                    <p>One thing is for certain – the art of good storytelling is in good hands at Doppelganger.</p>

                    <p>Don’t worry. You’re about to meet a man who’s just come out of prison for acts of extreme violence, but he’s calmed down now. The anger management counselling has worked. He’s a changed man. He’ll be able to cope with the problems of going straight. His lowlife old mates and criminal connections won’t drag him down, won’t bring the old bad habits back to life. He’ll impress the family court with his sobriety and clean living and be able to restore relations with his children … Maybe.</p>

                    <span class="tittle-line-modal"></span>
                    <p>Settling in Bournemouth with Fanny, his whirlwind American wife with whom he enjoyed a tempestuous relationship, Stevenson sought to stabilise his chronic state of health in climes milder than his beloved Edinburgh. Writing The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde proved to be as dramatic and psychotic as the tale itself.</p>

                    <p>The play dramatises the loving yet combative relationship between Stevenson and Fanny, with Stevenson almost wholly dependent on her for his physical well-being and emotional stability. Yet the famous author of Treasure Island took to heart Fanny’s critique of the first draft of his new work and this conflict is at the centre of the play, a two-hander between Stevenson and Fanny with the audience cast in the role of a Bournemouth literary group visiting Skerryvore.</p>
                    <p>Bedridden, inspired by a nightmare, Stevenson feverishly wrote the novella in three days, working without pause, only to destroy the first version. Over the next ten weeks, much of it spent in bed, pages scattered across the counterpane, the almost bankrupt Stevenson compulsively wrote and rewrote until his masterpiece was complete. During this febrile period of creativity, Stevenson was continually haunted by his darkside, the Edwards Hyde within him, his self-destructive impulses continually threatening to undermine the respectable front of his Bournemouth lifestyle.</p>
                    <p>Stevenson was often too ill to leave the house or even his bed. He nevertheless wrote with superhuman energy, likening the creative demon inside him to that ‘pallid brute’ Edward Hyde. Stevenson’s uneasy coexistence with upright Bournemouth society was like being ‘a weevil in a biscuit.’</p>

                    <h3>ABOUT</h3>
                    <span class="tittle-line-modal"></span>
                    <p>A contemporary retelling of Oscar Wilde’s Faustian tale. The beautiful Dory Gray, professional photographer of crime, war and celebrity, has made a pact with the Devil. A stunningly beautiful young man, Dorian Gray, has a photograph taken of himself by the woman he loves, Basel Hallward, locking his prepossessing good looks in the digital image for all time. Falling under the malign influence of the amoral Henri Wotton, Dorian is drawn into her hedonistic lifestyle and becomes her lover.
                        <p>Dorian strikes a Faustian pact with the Devil and acquires eternal youth. Immersing himself in a secret life of debauchery and crime, Dorian discovers a wantonly violent darkside to his personality. He gradually builds an international reputation as an award-winning news and celebrity photographer, covering such topics as famine, major disasters and crime, taking a particular interest in a serial murderer known as ‘The Rain Killer.’</p>
                        <p>The ravages of corruption and depravity are never reflected in Dorian’s enduringly handsome face. Only the photograph Basel once took of him reflects his dissolute soul.</p>

                        <h3>PREVIEW</h3>
                        <span class="tittle-line-modal"></span>
                        <p>An intense and punchy rethinking of one of Oscar Wilde’s most controversial and yet fascinating tales: The Picture of Dorian Grey.</p>
                        <p>Written by John Foster, directed by Charmaine K. Parkin and produced by Nick Taylor, the play comes to life on the stage where time and space condense in a fiery performance. A modern London gives birth to its characters and, almost standing as a silent narrator, it tells the story of Dorian Grey, whose beauty evokes that of an angel. Dorian decides to devote his life to debauchery and pleasure and trades his soul in exchange of eternal youth.</p>
                        <p>He grows an increasing interest in capturing with his camera the last scents of life in murdered bodies of prostitutes, attracted by the story of a mysterious serial killer known as the “rain killer.” But what the camera really captures is hidden in a picture of him taken by Basel, the woman he loves.</p>
                        <p>Brilliantly written, as the narrative unfolds it reveals and explores the duality of the characters, which slowly pervades the story, strongly echoing the atmosphere of this century. This is probably the challenge of the work: presenting to a modern disillusioned audience a story which strips their most intimate and hidden fears and desires.</p>
                        <p>Dorian is torn apart, divided between his true love for Basel and Henri’s sombre magnitude which in the end prevails and pulls out his darkest impulses. Hints of surrealism blend with a powerful almost painful realism.</p>
                        <p>The play explores themes of happiness and pleasure in a world where morality has vanished under a “painted veil” of vanity.</p>

                        <h3>REVIEW</h3>
                        <span class="tittle-line-modal"></span>
                        <p>THEATRE REVIEW – THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY – SIMON JAY – THEATRE AND PERFORMANCE GUIDE AND GURU</p>
                        <p>AWARDED FIVE STARS * * * * * ‘VIOLENT, ABUSIVE, DUPLICITOUS – THE REAL MR GRAY’</p>
                        <p>Oscar Wilde’s Novel about art, eternal youth and debauchery has become a supernatural cautionary tale for the twentieth and twenty-first century. Many writer’s since Wilde have taken the eponymous Dorian and had their wicked way with him, from Will Self’s very gay, eighties AID’s parable to Alan Moore’s comic book superhero. Even if you haven’t read Wilde’s book, you’re aware of or, or even refer to someone as ‘having a painting in the attic’.</p>
                        <p>John Foster takes the ‘attic’ and makes it a representation of the public consciousness in this contemporary… I wouldn’t call it a ‘version’ of Gray, more a mash-up, an inspiration, as we go light-years from the supernatural of Conan-Doyle’s Victorian London to the gritty, ugly media-sated world of 2015. He doesn’t write easy plays, they’re hard and ruthless, like cobalt; his dialogue sounds half 50’s pulp detective novel, half T.S Eliot’s The Wasteland; it is a totally unique voice. A voice pre-occupied by murder, sex, psychology and art. He doesn’t write to simply entertain, he writes to assault the audience with a barrage of imagery, words and ideas; there is so much to unpack in his plays, you certainly aren’t short-changed if you engage and open your mind.</p>
                        <p>We are introduced to Dorian Gray, a charismatic, young and provocative beauty, gesticulating wildly and talking in abstract poetics about the nature of his world, of murder and his career in photography. Alessandro Babalola, a lanky powerhouse of an actor, who engages you with every word, plays Gray brilliantly, no mean feat considering the dense and abstract dialogue you’re bombarded with.</p>
                        <p>We soon meet Basel Hallward and Henri Wotton rewritten as women as opposite and the two sides of Dorian himself. Basel is whimsical and mercurial but with a dash of the disturbed locked deep within, she falls for Dorian on a beach they both walk. You immediately feel safe with Basel played by Anna Newcome, an actor who embodies a role so deftly and with such originality it’s breathtaking and rewarding to watch. In this burgeoning romance we get a wafer-thin reminder of Wilde’s plot. Gray is photographed by Basel in the mortuary where she works, and the musings to never grow old and stay as the picture rears its metaphorical head.</p>
                        <p>Enter Henri Wotton, bipolar femme fatale and devilish vamp sophisticate in gorgeous high-heels; this character is so much fun yet so freakish I couldn’t help smiling from ear-to-ear every time Amelia Gardham came on stage. She was perhaps the most Wildean character in the play, concerned with maxims and philosophy; she got under the other characters skin and the audiences too! Gardham had us in the palm of her hand, she knew exactly what she was doing, and she has a natural talent destined for the great dark ladies of Shakespeare.</p>
                        <p>Soon Wotton takes Gray down a path of decadence and debauchery; all the while the news story he’s always first to photograph, the murdered prostitutes of ‘The Rain Killer’ is always in the background.</p>
                        <p>By the second act, the poetics takes back-stage for a more visceral study in action and inaction. We are immersed in daring bank-raids, war-scenes and violent murders. Parkin’s direction is particularly excellent in these sequences showing her skill in creating an oppressive and frightening mood with little dressing or bombastic effects.</p>
                        <p>This production of Dorian Gray feels like theatre of a bygone age, an age where theatre was a wide and dangerous sea, where you had no idea what you were going to see. It is an experience every serious theatregoer should be part of.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br> Your husband is a murderer and what the hell do you do?

                        <br> Step into the world of Gina, better known as Mrs Gina Bellemy, a wife with a secret. Meet Robin, her so-called better half.

                        <br> Enter an ordinary, suburban home where things are not quite as they seem and ask how far would you go for love?
                        <br>
                        <br> What is it like to wake up on an ordinary day in a suburban home along the quiet streets of houses and come to the realisation that your husband is a serial killer? The father of your children – the man you are again pregnant by – is the monster of the banner headlines?
                        <br>
                        <br> The murderer by strangulation of several young women. All of them brunettes women like you. Doubles of you.

                        <br> Your husband has been murdering different images of you.</p>

                                    I had the good fortune to see a rehearsal of The Murder Wife by John Foster before it makes its way to London. Performed by doppelgänger’s Janine Nerissa Broadhead and Laurent Lucas, it followed a tale of conflict and inner turmoil as A woman comes to terms with her husband being not only a serial killer but also having a deeply disturbing criteria for his victims.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Meanwhile Robin (the husband) callously and bluntly reflects on his thoughts and the deeds he has done coming to a bittersweet conclusion.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> The play touches on many dark facets of human emotion and desire as well as all to real issues such as social insecurity and victim shaming.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> I was captivated by the performances and relieved by twinkles of dark humour, I wouldlove to see it in London sometime.

                                    Recently watched a rehearsal of John Foster’s The Murder Wife before it goes to London.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Intense and convincing performances from both actors: we flit between a woman’s (Janinev Nerissa Broadhead) inner struggle with the fact that the father of her children is a serial killer, and his (Laurent C. Lucas) side of the story; a man who must come to understand and accept his own said monstrosity.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> The play (influenced by real-life murder cases) handles multiple themes, amongst them the power of maternal and spousal love, whether the capacity for evil is down to nature or nurture, and the media’s fascination with murder. Needless to say, subject matter is often bleak and disturbing, but a captivating watch punctuated by moments of dark comedy – time slips by in the hour-and- a-half runtime. <br>
                                    <br> Wishing very best of luck to cast and crew for their next performance!

                    <h3>ABOUT</h3>
                    <span class="tittle-line-modal"></span>
                    <p>The Sudden Madness of Friedrich Nietzsche is a drama investigating the life of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche as told through a series of lectures and demonstrations by Dr. Otto Binswanger at an Institute for the Care and Cure of the Insane in Jena, Germany in 1889. Dr. Binswanger is puzzled by aspects of Nietzsche’s clinical condition. He probes various theories as to the cause of his sudden madness with the patient in front of a group of students. Through this probing and the fragmented memories of Nietzsche’s we piece together key events which led to his mental breakdown. </p>
                    <p>A major focus of the drama is on Nietzsche’s relationship with his sister Elizabeth who both promoted and distorted his work after his mental collapse and went on to become a celebrated figure within Nazi Germany. She comes to look after Nietzsche following his eventual discharge from Binswanger’s care. The drama examines Nietzsche’s troubled relationship with Richard Wagner, with whom he fell out over the composer’s nationalism and anti-Semitism. It also explores the infamous friendship between Nietzsche, the Jewish intellectual Paul Reé and the brilliant young Russian writer Lou Von Salomé. The reading at the Winchester on the 29 th March is of Part 1 of this 4-part drama.</p>

                    <p>Nicola’s love of the arts goes back to childhood, when she spent eight years performing with a local amateur dramatics society. She went on to study Performing Arts at the Jellicoe Theatre and much later became drawn to a writing career, graduating as a Screenwriter in 2014. During that time she also gained experience in various films and theatrical plays, as a Writer, Director, Producer and Casting Director
                        <br>
                        <br> Nicola’s directorial debut short, ‘Stay with Me’, was recognised on the festival circuit in 2015, following her involvement in horror-thriller, ‘K-Shop’ from White Lantern Film. She also spent a summer filming ‘Who Killed Nelson Nutmeg?’ with Nelson Nutmeg Pictures Ltd.
                        <br>
                        <br> Nicola went on to co-write a second short film, then introduced herself to Doppelganger Productions as a Director for their new writers’ programme. Nicola continues to enjoy regular Doppelganger workshops, hoping to become more closely involved in theatre production and its’ growing presence in Bournemouth and beyond. She is also very happy to be taking on the role of Film Curator.

                    <p>Keely Saunders has an interest in all forms of theatre, and has been an avid theatre goer from a young age. Her involvement with the production of Trial by Ego, in association with Four and Twenty Blackbirds at the Shelley Theatre in 2013, galvanised a passion and interest in Stage Management. Keely is happiest with a script in hand, ensuring director and actors adhere to it!
                        <br>
                        <br> More recently, Keely co-founded the Winchester Pub Theatre, with the desire to reinvigorate fringe theatre within the Bournemouth area: this led to her appointment as Production Manager. Productions she has overseen include The Vagina Monologues, The Singing Bowl, The Tell-Tale Heart, Syd Barrett and Piaf. As a result, Keely was invited to join the Doppelganger team, her most recent involvement being producer of The Murder Wife Rehearsed Reading; she has also turned her talents to performance, appearing in The Sudden Madness of Friedrich Nietzsche and Doppelganger’s first Scratch Night.
